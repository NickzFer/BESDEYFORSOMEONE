        <p>Yeah, i know that it's too late, but if you really did open this up, i wanted to apologize for my action. For the reason is that
          i had too much problem lately. It is my fault but you should know that you are wrong too.
          Well, it's such a shame that the story ended like this. But, you should know that communication are 2 way you know?
          when i stopped texting you, we stopped talking. your "harga diri" was too high, i have value too yk?. Honestly, i dont hate you or anything like that but, be better fel.
          atleast dont fall for the same mistake. learn. Yeah, love was too soon for us, Yeah, we both was dumb. Yeah, it was a mistake.
          
          Once again, sorry.
          <p> </p>
        
          Sincerely, Nicolas Ferio
